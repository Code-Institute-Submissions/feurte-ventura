# Fuerte Ventura

This site was created for my second milestone project, for the Full Stack Developer Course.
The goal of this site is to inform consumers of the activities and amenities available around the island and get them to get a package deal.

## User Experience

The creation point is so that the consumer can learn it is more than just beaches on the islands, that there are activities and other things to do.

### User Stories

* As a resident of the island I want people to know there is a lot more than just beaches.

* I want to see the beaches and see if they are as nice as what people say.

* I want to be able to see surrounding areas of where I'm thinking of going.

## Features

### Existing Features

* Homepage - A picture from the pier of the beach and a bar, some information about the island and food. A form to receive a call back from an agent to book a deal.

* Popular Cities - A few of the popular Areas around the island and a little bit of information on the activities in the area and a google map api for each area.

* Gallery - A slide show of some photos of the beach and views.

### Additional Features

* Another page for consumers to post their own pictures.
